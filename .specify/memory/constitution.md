# TaskFlow Constitution

## Project Vision

TaskFlow is an AI-powered todo application that evolves from a simple console app to a fully-featured, cloud-native AI chatbot deployed on Kubernetes. This project demonstrates mastery of Spec-Driven Development, AI-native architecture, and modern cloud technologies—all using **free-tier services**.

**Problem Solved:** Managing personal tasks with natural language while learning progressive software architecture.

**Team Context:** Solo developer (hackathon participant)

**Development Philosophy:** Spec-Driven, AI-First, Test-First

---

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)

Every feature MUST begin with a specification before implementation.

**Guidelines:**
- Write `spec.md` before any code using the `/sp.specify` workflow
- Specifications define WHAT, not HOW
- All acceptance criteria must be testable and verifiable
- No manual coding allowed—refine specs until AI generates correct output

**Rationale:** Spec-driven development ensures clear requirements, reproducible AI-generated code, and traceable implementation decisions. This is the foundation of the hackathon methodology.

**Verification:** Check that `specs/<feature>/spec.md` exists before any implementation PR.

---

### II. AI-First Development

Leverage AI assistance (Claude Code) throughout the entire development lifecycle.

**Guidelines:**
- Use Claude Code for spec generation, planning, task breakdown, and implementation
- Maintain clear context through CLAUDE.md files at each project level
- All AI interactions must be recorded in Prompt History Records (PHRs)
- Verify AI outputs against specifications before acceptance
- **Always check available skills/agents before any action** (see CLAUDE.md Pre-Action Checklist)

**Rationale:** AI-first development maximizes productivity and demonstrates the "Architecture of Intelligence" theme. The developer acts as System Architect, not syntax writer.

**Verification:** PHR files exist in `history/prompts/` for all significant work.

---

### III. Test-First (TDD Mandatory)

Tests MUST be written before implementation code.

**Guidelines:**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
- Tests must fail before implementation (red phase)
- User approves test cases before implementation begins
- Minimum 80% code coverage for core business logic

**Rationale:** TDD ensures correctness, prevents regressions, and produces self-documenting code. Critical for multi-phase evolution where each phase builds on previous work.

**Verification:** CI pipeline enforces coverage thresholds; PRs require passing tests.

---

### IV. Free-Tier First

All external services MUST use free-tier offerings that do not require payment.

**Guidelines:**
- Prefer services with generous or always-free tiers
- Document all service limits and plan for graceful degradation
- No credit card charges—free credits or truly free tiers only
- Maintain list of alternative free services as fallbacks

**Rationale:** Demonstrates practical skills accessible to all developers. Ensures the project can be reproduced without financial barriers.

**Verification:** No paid service keys in `.env`; all services documented in Technology Stack with free tier limits.

---

### V. Progressive Architecture

The application MUST evolve through 5 defined phases without breaking previous functionality.

**Guidelines:**
- Each phase builds incrementally on the previous
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout evolution
- Clean separation of concerns enables phase transitions
- Monorepo structure keeps frontend/backend in single context

**Rationale:** Simulates real-world software evolution from MVP to production-grade distributed system.

**Verification:** All Phase N features still work after Phase N+1 implementation.

---

### VI. Stateless & Cloud-Native Design

All services MUST be designed for horizontal scalability and resilience.

**Guidelines:**
- Server holds NO state between requests (database is source of truth)
- Use JWT for stateless authentication
- Design for Kubernetes deployment from Phase II onward
- Support graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

**Rationale:** Cloud-native design enables the Kubernetes deployment phases and teaches production-ready architecture patterns.

**Verification:** Server restart doesn't lose any user data; multiple instances can run concurrently.

---

### VII. Simplicity & YAGNI

Implement only what is specified—no premature optimization or feature creep.

**Guidelines:**
- Start simple, add complexity only when required by specs
- No organizational-only abstractions; every abstraction must serve a purpose
- Prefer standard library solutions over external dependencies
- Remove unused code immediately

**Rationale:** Complexity must be justified. The hackathon evaluates spec compliance, not additional features.

**Verification:** Code review checks for unused imports, dead code, and unjustified abstractions.

## Governance

- This Constitution supersedes all other project documentation
- Amendments require: documented rationale in ADR, version bump, migration plan
- All implementations must verify compliance with Core Principles
- Exceptions require explicit documentation and approval
- Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance

### Document Hierarchy

```
Constitution (WHY) > Specify (WHAT) > Plan (HOW) > Tasks (DO)
```

If conflicts arise, higher-level documents take precedence.

### Version Control

- MAJOR: Breaking changes to principles or architecture
- MINOR: New principles, sections, or significant expansions
- PATCH: Clarifications, typos, non-semantic changes

### Compliance Verification

Every PR/implementation must answer:

1. Does this follow Spec-Driven Development? (Principle I)
2. Was this generated via AI assistance? (Principle II)
3. Were tests written first? (Principle III)
4. Does this use free-tier services only? (Principle IV)
5. Does this maintain backward compatibility? (Principle V)
6. Is the server stateless? (Principle VI)
7. Is this the simplest solution? (Principle VII)
