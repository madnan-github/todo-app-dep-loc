# Simulated kagent Cluster Analysis Report
# This represents what would be generated by kagent for cluster diagnostics

## Cluster Health Analysis
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-23T10:00:00Z
**Cluster Name:** minikube
**Kubernetes Version:** v1.30.0

### Node Status
- ✅ minikube (Ready, 2 CPUs, 8Gi Memory, 12Gi Disk)
- Pod Capacity: 110 pods
- Allocatable Resources: 1.8 CPU, 7.2Gi Memory

### Resource Allocation Summary
- **CPU Usage:** 45% (0.9/2.0 cores)
- **Memory Usage:** 32% (2.3Gi/8Gi)
- **Pod Count:** 8/110 (7%)

### Namespace Analysis
- **kube-system:** 5 pods, 0.1 CPU, 0.5 Gi Memory
- **default:** 1 pod, 0.05 CPU, 0.1 Gi Memory
- **todo-app:** 6 pods, 0.75 CPU, 1.7 Gi Memory (NEW NAMESPACE)

### Potential Issues Identified
1. **Medium Priority:** Some pods are running without resource limits
   - Recommendation: Add resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion

2. **Low Priority:** No monitoring stack deployed
   - Recommendation: Deploy Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **High Priority:** Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for backend service
   - Current static replica count may not handle traffic spikes efficiently

2. **Medium Priority:** Configure pod anti-affinity for high availability
   - Current deployment doesn't ensure pods are spread across nodes

### Security Findings
- ✅ All pods running as non-root users
- ⚠️ Some deployments lack network policies
- ✅ RBAC properly configured
- ✅ Image pull policy set to Always

### Performance Recommendations
1. Increase backend replica count during peak hours
2. Implement service mesh for better observability
3. Set up automated scaling based on CPU/memory metrics

### Resource Utilization Details
- **Most Resource-Intensive Pods:**
  1. todo-app-backend-7d5b8c9c4-xl2v9: 0.2 CPU, 0.5 Gi Memory
  2. todo-app-frontend-6b4c7d8e9-ab3cd: 0.15 CPU, 0.3 Gi Memory
