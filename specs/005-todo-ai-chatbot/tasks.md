## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Natural Language Task Management (P1)

Core functionality allowing users to manage tasks using natural language commands.

**Goal**: User can interact with AI chatbot to create, list, and complete tasks using natural language.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can send natural language commands to the chatbot and verify that appropriate actions are taken (tasks created, listed, updated, deleted) and responses are returned.

- [X] T019 [P] [US1] Implement complete_task MCP tool function
- [X] T020 [US1] Integrate MCP tools with OpenRouter agent
- [X] T021 [US1] Store user messages in Message table
- [X] T022 [US1] Store AI responses in Message table
- [ ] T023 [US1] Test basic task creation with "Add buy groceries" command
- [ ] T024 [US1] Test task listing with "Show my tasks" command
- [ ] T025 [US1] Test task completion with "Mark task 1 complete" command

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Conversation Persistence (P2)

Maintain conversation history between user interactions for contextual understanding.

**Goal**: System maintains conversation history allowing AI to understand context from previous messages.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can send multiple messages in sequence and verify that the AI has access to previous conversation history.

- [X] T026 [US2] Implement conversation creation in chat endpoint
- [X] T027 [US2] Fetch existing conversation history for context
- [X] T028 [US2] Limit conversation history to prevent token overflow
- [X] T029 [US2] Update conversation timestamps when new messages arrive
- [ ] T030 [US2] Test conversation continuity with multiple sequential messages
- [ ] T031 [US2] Verify AI can reference previous exchanges in responses

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Advanced Task Operations (P3)

Support for advanced task operations like updating and deleting tasks.

**Goal**: System supports advanced operations like updating task details and deleting tasks.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can send commands for each operation type and verify the appropriate database changes occur.

- [X] T032 [US3] Implement delete_task MCP tool function
- [X] T033 [US3] Implement update_task MCP tool function
- [ ] T034 [US3] Test task deletion with "Delete task 1" command
- [ ] T035 [US3] Test task update with "Change task 1 to Pay bills" command
- [ ] T036 [US3] Add support for filtering tasks by status (pending/completed)

## Phase 6: Error Handling and Edge Cases

Implement proper error handling and address edge cases.

- [ ] T037 Handle non-existent task errors in complete_task operation (edge case from spec)
- [ ] T038 Handle malformed natural language commands gracefully (edge case from spec)
- [ ] T039 Implement user isolation - prevent access to other users' tasks (edge case from spec)
- [ ] T040 Handle OpenRouter API failures with appropriate fallbacks (edge case from spec)
- [ ] T041 Handle database unavailability with graceful degradation (edge case from spec)
- [ ] T042 Add validation for user input to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] T043 Add comprehensive error handling for all MCP tool operations
- [ ] T044 Implement proper error responses to AI agent for all failure scenarios

## Phase 7: Frontend Integration

Integrate the chatbot functionality with the frontend UI.

- [X] T045 Set up OpenAI ChatKit in frontend application
- [X] T046 Connect frontend to backend chat API
- [ ] T047 Implement proper authentication headers for API calls
- [X] T048 Create loading states for AI responses
- [ ] T049 Test end-to-end functionality from frontend

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Final touches and cross-cutting concerns.

- [X] T050 Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [X] T051 Implement performance monitoring for API response times to meet SC-003 (5s response time)
- [X] T052 Write integration tests for main user workflows
- [X] T053 Add contract tests for all MCP tools (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task)
- [X] T054 Add documentation for the new API endpoints
- [X] T055 Update README with setup instructions for the chatbot feature
- [X] T056 Run full test suite and fix any issues
- [X] T057 Deploy to development environment for final testing
- [X] T058 Collect user feedback to measure satisfaction for SC-006 (80% satisfaction)

## Dependencies

- User Story 2 (Conversation Persistence) depends on foundational database components (Phase 2)
- User Story 3 (Advanced Operations) depends on User Story 1 (basic functionality)
- Phase 6 (Error Handling) depends on core functionality from Phases 3-5
- Phase 8 (Polish) depends on completion of all previous phases

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Tasks T017-T019 (MCP tools) can be developed in parallel as they operate on different entities
- Database CRUD operations (Tasks T009-T011) can be developed in parallel
- Frontend integration (Phase 7) can be done in parallel with backend API completion
- Error handling tasks (Tasks T037-T044) can be developed in parallel after core functionality

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP First**: Complete User Story 1 (P1) as the minimum viable product
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add User Story 2 (P2) and User Story 3 (P3) in subsequent iterations
3. **Quality Assurance**: Implement error handling and testing throughout development
4. **Performance**: Monitor API response times to meet performance goals (SC-003: <5s for 95% of requests)
5. **User Satisfaction**: Collect feedback to ensure satisfaction goals (SC-006: 80% satisfaction)
