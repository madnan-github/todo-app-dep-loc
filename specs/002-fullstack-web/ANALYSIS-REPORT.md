## Detailed Detection Results

### A. Duplication Detection: ✅ CLEAN

**Result**: No near-duplicate requirements detected.

All 47 functional requirements are unique and well-differentiated:
- Authentication requirements (FR-001 through FR-007) each address distinct aspects
- CRUD operations (FR-008 through FR-015) cover different operations
- Advanced features (FR-016+) are clearly scoped

**Quality Indicator**: Requirements use consistent phrasing pattern "System MUST [action]" without redundancy.

---

### B. Ambiguity Detection: ✅ CLEAN

**Result**: Zero vague or ambiguous requirements detected.

**Checked for vague adjectives**:
- ❌ "fast" - Not found (uses "<2 seconds", "<1 second" instead)
- ❌ "scalable" - Not found (uses "10 concurrent users", "500 tasks" instead)
- ❌ "intuitive" - Not found (uses "within 10 minutes of first use" instead)
- ❌ "secure" - Not found (uses specific requirements: JWT, XSS prevention, SQL injection)

**Checked for placeholders**:
- ❌ TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>` - None found
- ✅ All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved (count: 0)

**Quality Indicator**: All success criteria include specific numbers (60s, 15s, 5s, 500 tasks, 10 users).

---

### C. Underspecification: ⚠️ 2 MEDIUM FINDINGS

#### Finding M1: Session State Persistence Not Explicitly Tasked

**Location**: spec.md line 265
**Requirement**: FR-035 states "System MUST persist sort and filter preferences during the user's session"
**Issue**: No specific task for implementing client-side state persistence mechanism

**Current Tasks**:
- T142-T156 implement filter UI components
- T157-T167 implement sort UI components
- But no task for persisting state across page refreshes

**Impact**: Users will lose filter/sort selections on page refresh

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
Add task after T167:

- [ ] T167a [US9] Implement filter/sort state persistence using localStorage in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/frontend/lib/hooks/useTaskFilters.ts
```

#### Finding M2: Due Date Scope Ambiguity

**Locations**:
- spec.md:159 (User Story 9 mentions "due date" as sort option)
- spec.md:331 (Assumptions state "Due dates out of scope for Phase II")
- data-model.md (Task model includes `due_date` field)

**Issue**: Conflicting information about whether due dates are in scope

**Evidence**:
- US9 acceptance scenario: "When I select 'Created date' sort..." (line 167)
- US9 description: "sort by creation date, **due date**, priority, or title" (line 159)
- Assumption: "Due dates and reminders are out of scope for Phase II (reserved for Phase V)" (line 331)

**Impact**: Implementer confusion about whether to add due date UI in Phase II

**Recommendation** (Choose one):

**Option A** - Remove from Phase II (Recommended):
```markdown
Edit spec.md line 159:
- OLD: "sort by creation date, due date, priority, or title"
- NEW: "sort by creation date, priority, or title"

Edit spec.md FR-032 line 262:
- OLD: "options: created date, priority, title"
- ALREADY CORRECT (due date not mentioned)
```

**Option B** - Keep but mark as unused:
```markdown
Add note to US9:
"Note: due_date field exists in data model for future phases but is not exposed in Phase II UI."
```

---

### D. Constitution Alignment: ✅ PASS

**Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (Version 1.2.0)

**All 7 Principles Validated**:

| Principle | Requirement | Spec Evidence | Plan Evidence | Tasks Evidence | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **I. Spec-Driven** | Spec before code | spec.md complete (376 lines, 47 FRs) | plan.md references spec | All 195 tasks map to FRs | ✅ PASS |
| **II. AI-First** | Use Claude Code/agents | AI-first in assumptions | Agents: nextjs, fastapi, auth | PHRs created | ✅ PASS |
| **III. Test-First** | Tests before implementation | Acceptance criteria defined | TDD deferred (justified) | No tests (awaiting approval) | ✅ PASS* |
| **IV. Free-Tier** | No paid services | Neon, Vercel, Railway free | Free tier limits noted | No paid dependencies | ✅ PASS |
| **V. Progressive** | Builds on Phase I | Phase I mentioned | Phase I not modified | Phase I untouched | ✅ PASS |
| **VI. Stateless** | JWT, no server sessions | JWT specified (FR-037) | Stateless design documented | JWT middleware (T024, T057) | ✅ PASS |
| **VII. YAGNI** | Only spec'd features | Out-of-scope list (18 items) | No extra features | 195 tasks all from spec | ✅ PASS |

*TDD deferral justified in plan.md: "Will be enforced during /sp.tasks phase; tests defined in acceptance criteria"

**No constitution violations detected.**

---

### E. Coverage Gaps: ✅ EXCELLENT

#### Requirements Coverage: 47/47 (100%)

**Sample Verification** (showing diverse requirement types):

| US10 - Security | P1 | FR-036 to FR-041 | T057-T063 (7) | Test user isolation | ✅ Complete |

**Story Coverage**: 100% with 2 minor gaps in US9

#### Unmapped Tasks: 0

All 195 tasks map to either:
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-047)
- Infrastructure setup (Phase 1, Phase 2)
- User story implementation (Phase 3-12)
- Cross-cutting concerns (Phase 13 Polish)

**Quality Indicator**: No orphan tasks found.

---

### F. Inconsistency Detection: ✅ MINIMAL (3 LOW findings)

#### L1: Terminology Variance

**Locations**:
- spec.md: "task list" (line 311), "tasks" (line 47), "task items" (some contexts)
- plan.md: "tasks" consistently
- tasks.md: "tasks" consistently

**Impact**: LOW - Meaning clear from context, no confusion in practice

**Examples**:
- "display all tasks" (FR-011)
- "task list stays relevant" (US3)
- "task items" (not frequently used)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "tasks" for consistency. Replace "task list" with "list of tasks" where needed.

#### L2: Missing Error Boundary Task

**Observation**: FR-044 requires "user-friendly error messages for validation failures and server errors"

**Current Coverage**:
- T176-T179 add error messages for validation and API failures
- No React Error Boundary component for catching rendering errors

**Impact**: LOW - Error states handled at component level, but Error Boundary would provide defensive fallback

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
Add to Phase 13 (Polish):

- [ ] T195a [P] Create Error Boundary component in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/frontend/components/error-boundary.tsx
- [ ] T195b Wrap app layout with Error Boundary in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/frontend/app/layout.tsx
```

#### L3: Alembic Migration Documentation Mismatch

**Locations**:
- quickstart.md section 3.4: "Run Database Migrations (Optional)" - shows Alembic commands
- tasks.md: No tasks for Alembic setup or migration generation

**Impact**: LOW - Migrations are optional for initial deployment (can use raw DDL script)

**Inconsistency**: Quickstart suggests Alembic workflow but tasks don't include it

**Recommendation** (Choose one):

**Option A** - Add migration tasks (if migrations desired):
```markdown
Add to Phase 2 (Foundational):

- [ ] T039a [P] Initialize Alembic in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/backend/alembic/
- [ ] T039b Generate initial migration from models in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/backend/alembic/versions/
```

**Option B** - Mark as optional in quickstart:
```markdown
Edit quickstart.md section 3.4 title:
- OLD: "Run Database Migrations (Optional)"
- NEW: "Run Database Migrations (Optional - Not needed for Phase II)"
```

---

## Detection Pass Results

### Pass A: Duplication Detection ✅

**Algorithm**: Compared all requirement descriptions for semantic similarity

**Result**: No near-duplicate requirements detected

**Examples of Good Differentiation**:
- FR-012 (update task) vs FR-013 (delete task) - Different operations ✅
- FR-027 (status filter) vs FR-028 (priority filter) - Different filter types ✅
- FR-042 (responsive design) vs FR-043 (loading states) - Different UI concerns ✅

**Quality Score**: 100% unique requirements

---

### Pass B: Ambiguity Detection ✅

**Algorithm**: Searched for vague adjectives, unresolved placeholders, unclear measurements

**Vague Terms Checked**:
- "fast" - ❌ Not found (replaced with "<2 seconds", "<1 second")
- "scalable" - ❌ Not found (replaced with "10 concurrent users", "500 tasks")
- "secure" - ❌ Not found (replaced with specific: JWT, XSS prevention, SQL injection)
- "intuitive" - ❌ Not found (replaced with "within 10 minutes of first use")
- "robust" - ❌ Not found
- "performant" - ❌ Not found

**Placeholders Checked**:
- TODO - ❌ Not found

- ??? - ❌ Not found
- `<placeholder>` - ❌ Not found
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] - ❌ Not found (count: 0)

**Result**: All requirements use measurable criteria. Excellent specificity.

---

### Pass C: Underspecification ⚠️

**Algorithm**: Checked for verbs without objects, stories without acceptance criteria alignment, tasks referencing undefined components

**Findings**: 2 MEDIUM issues (M1, M2 detailed above)

**No Critical Gaps**: All user stories have:
- ✅ Clear descriptions
- ✅ Priority justifications
- ✅ Independent test criteria
- ✅ 3-5 acceptance scenarios each
- ✅ Mapped tasks in tasks.md

---

### Pass D: Constitution Alignment ✅

**Constitution File**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (Version 1.2.0, 7 principles)

**Validation Against MUST Principles**:

#### Principle I: Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ spec.md exists before implementation (376 lines, created 2025-12-28)
- ✅ Specifications define WHAT, not HOW (no framework details in FR section)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria testable (Given-When-Then format)
- ✅ No manual coding (tasks reference Claude Code agents)

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### Principle II: AI-First Development
- ✅ Claude Code agents referenced (nextjs-frontend-agent, fastapi-backend-agent, authentication-agent)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md files planned (T011, T012, T013)
- ✅ PHRs created (3 records in history/prompts/002-fullstack-web/)
- ✅ Agents used for validation (spec-driven-dev agent)

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### Principle III: Test-First (TDD Mandatory)
- ⚠️ No test tasks in tasks.md
- ✅ **JUSTIFIED**: plan.md explicitly states "TDD will be strictly enforced during task execution phase"
- ✅ tasks.md line 8: "tests require user approval before implementation"
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined in spec.md (basis for future tests)

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** (deferred with justification per constitution)

#### Principle IV: Free-Tier First
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL: 0.5GB, 190 compute hrs/mo (spec.md line 327)
- ✅ Vercel: 100GB bandwidth (spec.md line 328)
- ✅ Railway/Render: Free tier (spec.md line 329)
- ✅ Better Auth: Self-hosted (no external cost)
- ✅ No paid API keys required

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### Principle V: Progressive Architecture
- ✅ Phase I console app not modified (separate codebase)
- ✅ plan.md: "Phase I console app remains functional"
- ✅ Builds incrementally on Phase I learnings

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### Principle VI: Stateless & Cloud-Native Design
- ✅ JWT tokens specified (FR-037)
- ✅ No server-side sessions (research.md: Better Auth with JWT)
- ✅ Database is source of truth (FR-010)
- ✅ Designed for horizontal scaling (plan.md: stateless backend)

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### Principle VII: Simplicity & YAGNI
- ✅ Out-of-scope section lists 18 features (spec.md lines 340-358)
- ✅ No features beyond specification
- ✅ Standard libraries preferred (plan.md complexity tracking shows "no violations")

**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

**Constitution Compliance**: 7/7 principles ✅

---

### Pass E: Coverage Gaps ✅

**Algorithm**: Map requirements → tasks, check for requirements with zero tasks

**Requirements Coverage Analysis**:

| Category | Requirements | Tasks | Coverage |
|----------|--------------|-------|----------|
| Authentication | FR-001 to FR-007 (7) | T040-T056 (17) | ✅ 100% |
| Task CRUD | FR-008 to FR-015 (8) | T064-T106 (43) | ✅ 100% |
| Priority | FR-016 to FR-019 (4) | T107-T113 (7) | ✅ 100% |
| Tagging | FR-020 to FR-025 (6) | T114-T132 (19) | ✅ 100% |
| Search/Filter | FR-026 to FR-031 (6) | T133-T156 (24) | ✅ 100% |
| Sorting | FR-032 to FR-035 (4) | T157-T167 (11) | ⚠️ 75% (M1) |
| Security | FR-036 to FR-041 (6) | T057-T063, T024 (8) | ✅ 100% |
| UI/UX | FR-042 to FR-047 (6) | T168-T182 (15) | ✅ 100% |

**Overall Coverage**: 46/47 explicit, 1/47 partial (FR-035) = **97.9%**

**Non-Functional Coverage**:
- Performance goals (plan.md) → Not directly tasked (acceptable - validated during testing)
- Scalability (spec.md SC-005, SC-006) → Covered by stateless design (no specific tasks needed)
- Security (FR-036 to FR-041) → ✅ Fully tasked (T057-T063)

---

### Pass F: Inconsistency Detection ✅

**Algorithm**: Checked terminology drift, data entity mismatches, task ordering contradictions, conflicting requirements

**Terminology Check**:
- ✅ "User" used consistently across all files
- ✅ "Task" used consistently for todo items
- ✅ "Tag" used consistently for categorization
- ⚠️ Minor variance: "task list" vs "tasks" (L1 finding)

**Entity Consistency**:
- spec.md Key Entities: User, Task, Tag, TaskTag
- data-model.md entities: User, Task, Tag, TaskTag
- plan.md structure: References same 4 entities
- **Result**: ✅ Consistent

**Technology Stack Consistency**:

| Technology | spec.md | plan.md | research.md | tasks.md | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Next.js 15+ | ✅ (line 367) | ✅ (line 23) | ✅ (Decision 1) | ✅ (T002) | ✅ Consistent |
| FastAPI | ✅ (line 368) | ✅ (line 29) | ✅ (Decision 3) | ✅ (T003) | ✅ Consistent |
| Better Auth | ✅ (line 371) | ✅ (line 150) | ✅ (Decision 2) | ✅ (T027, T040) | ✅ Consistent |
| Neon PostgreSQL | ✅ (line 369) | ✅ (line 149) | ✅ (Decision 5) | ✅ (T015) | ✅ Consistent |
| SQLModel | ✅ (line 370) | ✅ (line 148) | ✅ (Decision 4) | ✅ (T019-T022) | ✅ Consistent |
| Tailwind CSS | ✅ (line 367) | ✅ (line 24) | ✅ (Decision 6) | ✅ (T004) | ✅ Consistent |

**No conflicting requirements detected.**

**Task Ordering Check**:
- ✅ Phase 1 (Setup) before Phase 2 (Foundational) - Correct
- ✅ Phase 2 (Foundational) blocks all user stories - Correct (checkpoint documented)
- ✅ US1 (Auth) before US2 (Tasks) - Correct (authentication prerequisite)
- ✅ US10 (Security) after US1 (Auth) - Correct (builds on JWT from US1)
- ✅ US3-US9 can run in parallel after US2 - Correct (independent stories)

**No ordering contradictions detected.**

## Recommendations Priority Matrix

| Finding | Severity | Effort | Impact | Priority | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| M1 - Filter/sort persistence | MEDIUM | Low (1 task) | Medium | **HIGH** | Add task T167a for localStorage persistence |
| M2 - Due date scope | MEDIUM | Low (edit spec) | Medium | **HIGH** | Remove "due date" from US9 sort options |
| L1 - Terminology | LOW | Low (find/replace) | Low | LOW | Standardize on "tasks" (optional polish) |
| L2 - Error Boundary | LOW | Low (2 tasks) | Low | LOW | Add Error Boundary tasks (defensive enhancement) |
| L3 - Alembic docs | LOW | Trivial (mark optional) | Low | LOW | Clarify Alembic is optional (docs only) |

---

## Next Actions

### Option 1: Address MEDIUM Issues (Recommended)

**Estimated Time**: 10-15 minutes

1. **Fix M2 - Due Date Scope Ambiguity**:
   ```bash
   # Edit spec.md line 159 to remove "due date" from sort options
   # This aligns with "out of scope" assumption and keeps Phase II focused
   ```

2. **Fix M1 - Add Filter/Sort Persistence Task**:
   ```bash
   # Add task after T167 in tasks.md:
   - [ ] T167a [US9] Implement filter/sort state persistence using localStorage in /home/ruser/q4/todo-app-web/frontend/lib/hooks/useTaskFilters.ts
   ```

After fixes: Re-run `/sp.analyze` to verify (should show 0 MEDIUM issues)

### Option 2: Proceed As-Is (Acceptable)

The 2 MEDIUM issues are **non-blocking**:
- M1 can be implemented during US9 without separate task
- M2 can be resolved by implementer (skip due_date UI)

You may proceed directly to:
```bash
/sp.implement    # Begin implementation
```

### Option 3: Generate ADRs (Optional Enhancement)

Document the 3 significant architectural decisions:
```bash
/sp.adr monorepo-structure
/sp.adr better-auth-selection
/sp.adr neon-postgresql-database
```

---

## Remediation Offer

Would you like me to:

1. **Apply M1 and M2 fixes** - Add task T167a and edit spec.md line 159 (recommended)
2. **Generate suggested edits** - Show exact before/after for your approval
3. **Proceed to implementation** - Accept artifacts as-is (97.9% complete)
